# Signal Processing Educational Platform

## Overview

This project is a web-based **Signal Processing Educational Platform** designed to help users understand and interact with key concepts in signal processing. It provides an intuitive interface to create, modify, and visualize signals, enabling users to explore how different filters and transformations affect signals in both the time and frequency domains. This platform serves as an educational tool for students, engineers, and enthusiasts who want to deepen their understanding of signal processing principles.

## Features

### 1. **Interactive Signal Visualization**

- Graph signals dynamically in the time and frequency domains.
- Modify signal parameters (e.g., amplitude, frequency) and observe changes in real time.

### 2. **Toolset for Signal Analysis**

- Toggle between time-domain and frequency-domain views.
- Zoom, pan, and interact with signal plots.
- Compute key properties such as:
  - Signal power.
  - Mean value.
  - Signal energy.

### 3. **Custom Signal Input**

- Input mathematical functions to define custom signals.
- Support for predefined and user-defined signal types, such as:
  - Rectangular functions (e.g., `rect`)
  - Triangular functions (e.g., `tri`)
  - Sinc functions (e.g., `sinc`)
  - Heaviside step functions, and more.

### 4. **Filter Application**

- Apply common signal processing filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, etc.).
- Design and implement custom filters for advanced users.

### 5. **Educational Support**

- Includes an integrated chatbot that answers questions about signal processing concepts, applications, and mathematical foundations.
- Provides explanations for transformations, filters, and properties in an easy-to-understand format.
